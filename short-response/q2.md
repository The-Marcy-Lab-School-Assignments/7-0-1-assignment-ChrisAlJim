# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer

1. `No dependency (null)`

- If no dependency is provided then the function will log "Hello World" to the console every time the component is rendered.

2. `[]`

- The function will only log "Hello World" to the console once.

3. `[someState]`

- The function will run every time the state is updated.
