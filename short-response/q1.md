# Question

What are the two arguments that `useEffect` accepts?

# Answer

The two arguments `useEffect` accepts is a callback function and optional dependencies. If no dependencies are provided, the callback function will only run every time the component re-renders. If an empty array is provided for dependencies, it will run only once. If an array with values is provided, the callback function will execute every time the value changes.
